The company is now a part of Diageo, a company formed via the merger of Guinness  and Grand Metropolitan in 1997. The main product produced at the brewery is Guinness Draft.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeased for 9,000 years in 1759 by Arthur Guinness at \\xa345 per year, St. James's Gate has been the home of Guinness ever since. It became the largest brewery in Ireland in 1838, and was the largest in the world in 1914, covering 64 acres. Although no longer the largest brewery in the world, it is still the largest brewer of stout in the world. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the brewery owned most of the buildings in the surrounding area, including many streets of housing for brewery employees, and offices associated with the brewery. The brewery also made all of its own power using its own power plant.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere is an attached exhibition on the 250-year-old history of Guinness, called the Guinness Storehouse.\",\n",

They bonded over being put into the worst dorm for overseas orientation and teaching Danish people how to play beer pong. Though after three months Bailey went back to Cambridge, you can't break the bonds that are made when teaching Europeans drinking games and a true friendship was born. During the next eight years, they both graduated, Bailey went off to Vanderbilt Law School, and Robyn entered the working world, but both thought they were meant for much bigger and more alcoholic things.\",\n",

From being castigated by our West Marin neighbors to finally suffering an 'eviction' by our West Marin septic system. From landing in the welcoming arms of Petaluma, and actually getting our beer into bottles, onto the streets, and into the hands of sympathatic beer geeks, to steadily losing less money each month. From all this and more, Lagunitas Brewing Company is emerging as a battle-tested brewery capable of making great beer out of goat's milk, brambles, and asphalt on the surface of the Moon, if need be.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs the poet once said, 'Where, but for the grace of God and the kindness of strangers, go I'.

       "   u'description': u\"The Portsmouth Brewery, New Hampshire's first brewpub, was founded in 1991, four years after its sister company, the Northampton Brewery, opened in Western Massachusetts. Peter Egelston, Head Brewer in Northampton from 1987 until 1991, moved to Portsmouth to set up the new brewery here. (Egelston is now the sole proprietor of the Brewery.) \\r\\n\\r\\nThe brewing system consists of a custom made seven-barrel (210 gallons) JV Northwest brewhouse, two fourteen-barrel and three seven-barrel JV Northwest unitank (cylindroconical) fermenters, two fourteen-barrel horizontal fermenters (added later, in 1994), and twelve seven-barrel grundy cellar tanks. Originally, the Portsmouth Brewery opened with beer recipes from Northampton - Pale Ale, Old Brown Dog, Weizenheimer, Black Cat Stout, Blonde Ale, Golden and Amber Lagers - and these still comprise the core of the Brewery's full-time beers today. However, over the years, successive brewers have contributed many outstanding seasonal and specialty beers to the list.  All of the beers served at the Portsmouth Brewery are brewed right here on premise, with the exception of those beers, such as Shoals Pale Ale and Portsmouth Lager, brewed at Smuttynose Brewing Company, our sister company.\",\n",

       "   u'description': u'February 17, 1997 marked the official beginning of SweetWater Brewery, and a new style of brewing and selling beer in Atlanta as the boys wandered around Atlanta in an old van with Freddy\\'s dog Badger. After ending up on the wrong side of the tracks a few times, they were finally pointed in the direction of Virginia-Highlands and found a few bars willing to take a chance on them. \"We\\'ll give you a shot as long as your dog stops begging for leftovers on our patio\" was the cautious approval they needed to get the brand rolling.\\r\\n\\r\\nSweetWater\\'s second and current location is in Midtown Atlanta, adjacent to Ansley Park, in the Armour Circle Industrial Park just off of Piedmont and Monroe. The boys saved all of their pennies to buy the 25,000 square feet of brewing goodness and smack in the middle of all the action. Since the company began we\\'ve wanted to be closer to our homes, the bars and stores that sell our beer, and all the good folks that drink it. Fortunately seven years of great growth gave the company that opportunity. We learned a lot from that location and left all those mistakes behind as we built our new home. SweetWater Brewing Company has been here since 2004 and it feels good to be settled in. Our new home has enough capacity to brew 100,000 barrels of beer a year (A few more years at this rate.)',\n",
